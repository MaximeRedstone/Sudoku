Summarise your findings here (see specification).

Using a timer to see how long the recursive function takes to find a
solution for the three mystery boards, I find that:

-Mystery1 takes about 450 ms to run
-Mystery2 takes about 10 ms to run
-Mystery3 takes about 10ms to run

The function returns a solution for Mystery1 and Mystery3. Mystery1 and Mystery3 must be the hard and extremely hard Sudoku
boards.

As the function takes much more time to solve Mystery1, I argue this
is the extremely hard Sudoku board.

Mystery3 is therefore the hard Sudoku board.

The remaining board that cannot be solved (Mystery2) is therefore the
impossible one to solve.
